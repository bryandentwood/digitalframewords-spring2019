A Look To 2020: How Important is Instagram for Presidential Candidates?

### Lede

Instagram may be the most important social media asset for increasing audience engagement 
leading up to the 2020 presidential election, according to Congressional Research Service analysts.

From 2015 to 2017, Instagram was the quickest adopted social media platform for members of Congress, according to 
a CRS report, “Social Media Adoption by Members of Congress.” Figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during the 
2018 midterm elections showed that grabbing voter attention is less bout the number of followers you have and
more about the frequency and intention by which one posts.

### Data Questions

1. What type of persons have the highest number of followers?
Celebrities make a large majority of the top Instagram users. More specifically, musicians, athletes and actors
have the highest number of followers in that order.

2. Does the number of followers correlate to audience engagement?
No, not necessarily. Niall Horan, a musician, has the highest rate of audience engagement, but is ranked 50th 
in number of followers. Further data reveals that intentionality and frequency of posting are arguably
more important to audience engagement.

4. How is audience engagement determined?
According to Iconosquare, the source of the data, engagement rate is based on the likes and comments received 
divided by the number of followers at the time of the post.

### Data Steps

1. Order data according to number of followers
2. Reorder data according to engagement rate
3. Reorder table according to number of media posts
4. Analyze across tables - find that it’s not about number of posts, but intention (back up with support from source)
5. Rerank according to engagement rate, place alongside table
(=(cell)+1), drag down formula
6. Create a pivot table to find what type of celebrities have the highest number of followers 
7. Average the ranking numbers to analyze correlation between number of followers and audience engagement rating.
