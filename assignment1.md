### [Is Climate Change Making Hurricanes Worse?](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/ng-interactive/2018/sep/11/atlantic-hurricanes-are-storms-getting-worse)

Some North Carolina residents remain homeless 6 months after Hurricane Florence struck their area in September causing the most devastating flooding in a decade. How much money was spent by the government, private sector and non-profits to help displaced persons relocate?  Will exploring spending data over the last decade reveal more homeless and need for shelter alongside the growing intensity and quantity of superstorms? 


#### Objective: Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

4 -- Based on the headline and it being a question, the reporter aimed to explore the conversation around intensifying climate disasters. The subhead was more direct pointing to worrying long-term trends. It was not a 5 because the main headline had room to reveal as much as the subhead does.
 
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent

3 -- The opening graphic was helpful in drawing out the last 4 decades of storm patterns. The duration of the graphic however doesn’t invoke the same emotion as the rest of the article, which heavily warns readers about the consequences of climate change. The graphic could be improved by allowing the reader to compare decades side by side to realize the most recent decade experienced the heaviest damage and spending. Subsequent graphics are helpful but dense and the article could improve by interspersing more engaging, less complicated data displays.

* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate

3 -- Using my own knowledge, I have full confidence in the Guardian’s standards for data reporting, so expect the report to be as currently accurate as possible. However, as an uninformed reader, the Guardian reporter could have mentioned the National Hurricane Center because it appeared to be the central source of the relevant data. The article successfully cited the sources of the graphics’ data, reports, and helpful articles, but the process by which the reporter deciphered unbiased data could have been disclosed. Transparency is key to building a relationship with the publication’s audience.

#### Objective: Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

4 -- Yes, the piece accomplished its goal. The reporter presented the message upfront, that storms are increasingly more intense and damaging, they presented data to support their claim, and included engaging visuals that complimented the text. Any critiques are above in the data visuals analysis.

The graphics were straightforward but dry. It could have done better to compare the past decade of storm damage with videos or photos that depict the impact on communities, homes, or cities.


#### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?

4 -- The color is streamlined throughout. The Guardian has clearly put time into a brand, but I’m not sure red, orange and yellow were the strongest combination of colors. I wish there was a greater use of real-life photos/video to add color to the graphics. As for the story, it aligned with its data focus.

5 -- The fonts were on brand and professional. The type presented no unnecessary distractions from the story.

### Objective: Creativity

2 -- This was the weakest element of the article. I’d suggest using more experiential visuals to bring the reader closer to those affected by increasing storms. It was never over the top, which I prefer to the opposite effect when there is an overload of content. However, the graphics were never exciting nor did they invoke emotion. 



### [Boys — the silent victims of sex trafficking](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/nation-now/2018/02/08/boys-silent-victims-sex-trafficking/1073799001/)

Human trafficking is affecting trans boys at a rate higher than any other marginalized group, USA Today reported in February 2018. The topic received renewed attention during large-scale events like the Super Bowl every winter, but human trafficking is happening every day and in every city in the US. Map and data graphics and policy timelines would provide color to existing reporting and could explain an often confused topic. Data from the International Labour Organization and various human trafficking groups reveals an extensive network for human trafficking, so how has US policy shifted with trends of those most affected? What other groups are facing similar adversity without much  state-sponsored support? What more can be done in what areas? 

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

5 -- The title and opening anecdote made it clear that the piece was going to be about boys who have been subject to human trafficking. 
 
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent

1 -- I chose this article because there is endless potential for data visualization but the piece makes no use of them. The reporter cites several reports, statistics, and provides first-hand testimonies. Further, they explain the process for which young boys are recruited and manipulated into sex networks. Maps would be crucial to geographically identifying where these processes happen the most and who it disproportionately affects.

* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate

3 -- Using my own knowledge, I have full confidence in USA Today’s standards for data reporting, so expect the report to be as currently accurate as possible. However,  data surrounding sex trafficking is rarely completely accurate because of how difficult it is to find victims or survivors so willing to self-identify as victims. It’s close to impossible to further understand how large sex operations are because of the perpetrators’ silence. As for what sources are available, it’s clear the reporter did their best with what they could find.

### Objective: Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

3 -- Yes, the piece accomplished its textual goal. The reporter made the message clear upfront and followed up with extensive research and personal testimony. Although first-hand stories add color to the data, visualization is key to simplifying the nuanced topic.

The graphics were nonexistent.


### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?

1 -- There are no colors other than blue for linked articles, but this is most likely a default setting for embedding a link.

2 -- The type font is simple Times New Roman, professional, clean but not engaging. 

### Objective: Creativity

1 -- This was the weakest element of the article. I’d suggest using more visuals to bring the reader closer to the boy subjects of the article. It had no data visualization, but the opportunities are plenty. This would be a great chance for me to fill the vacuum of their colorless reporting for a crucial topic.
