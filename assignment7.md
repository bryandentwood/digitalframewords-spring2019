I found that the House of Representatives has steadily increased funding for delegation trips to 
Poland every year since 2014 when Ukraine annexed Crimea. In 2018, the House increased Poland 
delegation spending by almost 280 percent, or about $45k. 

To contextualize this story, I will explain why NATO and US forces are interested in increasing
their presence in the former East bloc of the Soviet Union. By analyzing the number of and money 
spent on codels, or congressional delegations, to Poland, its clear that the US has seriously ramped 
up interest in the country as a potential stronghold in the region, despite some analysts saying it would 
be exacerbate the Russian aggression.

To find my story, I did the following:
1. Searched the House Office of the Clerk Foreign Travel Disclosure Forms for 2015 and 2018
2. Filtered for dollars spent on House delegations to Poland in 2015 and inputted into Excel sheet
3. Found the sum total $ spent on House delegations to Poland in 2015
4. Repeat 2 and 3 for 2018 House delegations to Poland

Hed: Congress About Triples Travel Spending to Poland in Three Years

Nut Graph: In 2015, NATO reassessed the growing threat of Russia in the region and over the last three 
years, the US House of Representatives has responded with interest, spending over $60k in 2018 alone to 
fly members to Poland. The President of Poland in November 2018 offered the Trump administration $2B to 
help the US build a permanent base, which he proposed would be called “Fort Trump.”
