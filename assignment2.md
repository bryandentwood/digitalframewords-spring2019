## Abstract
The dataset explores the Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts of active politicians with the most followers to explore social media campaigning. It includes the change rate for number of followers and posts over a timeline beginning 6 months before and 6 months after respective campaigns (indicated by -6/+6). In detail, the data set analyzes the number of videos, photos, text or any combination posted per month of the campaign and beginning term.

## Purpose
Social media experts can use this data to explore what forms of media in combination are most successful at catching voter attention before and after a campaign.

## Method
Because of I was limited by analytic tools, described below, I google'd specific dates for AOC's tweets. Then, I manually recorded respective data points.

## Limitations & Improvements
Twitter analytics tools can only track followers as far as 3 months from the present day. 
The Twitter platform will only allow users to scroll back so far, thus the method above.

To expand, the data set should include variance by gender, position (House, Senate, Executive, Local, etc.), age, etc.
