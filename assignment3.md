### Instructions

1. The website [here](https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate-by-age-group.htm#indicator-chart), which is the source of the raw data, won’t allow the downloader to accomplish the above purpose, so first start with the 15-24 age range as my primary
template to copy and paste other age range data sets. 

2. Delete any country row not labelled “ISL.” 

3. There’s a column for “flag codes” but ISL had no numbers listed, so I deleted the column.

4. Download 24-54 age range data set. Copy “ISL” rows. 

5. Paste the 24-54 “ISL” data into the final document. 

6. Repeat for 55-64 age range data set.

7. Once all data is compiled into one document saved as “Final Consolidated,” title the dataset “Israel Employment Rate (%) by Age Group.” 

8. Delete columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 because that information is reserved in the title.

9. Label new columns left to right “2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018”

10. Label new rows top to bottom “15-24, 25-54, 55-64”

11. Re-input data accordingly
