## Final Assignment Pitch 

I plan to compile a social media dataset exploring current campaign strategy 
for popular politicians across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. I’ll analyze 
which types of posts received the most engagement by shares, follows and likes 
on a given post. This data will give social media campaigns more insight into 
what forms of media in combination are most successful for catching voter attention 
leading up to and post-campaign season. A limitation is that twitter only allows 
public tracking as far back as 3 months months. Thus, the timeline will go back 
three months and track to the start date of tracking.

This data is timely as we enter the 2020 presidential and congressional races. 

In pre-production, my research will rely on existing social media polling that 
confirms what types of media posts are most successful for political candidates. 
Most of these statistics come from marketing sites like Social Media Today, etc. 

A circle chart would help visualize the percentage of a candidate’s posts in the 
last 3 months were plainly text, video, picture, share or combination of media. A 
bar chart would help breakdown the number of likes, shares and comments per form of media.
