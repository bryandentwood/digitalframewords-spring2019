## Final Assignment Pitch 

In the wake of the 2020 election, I'll compile a social media dataset exploring current 
campaign strategy for Democratic candidates across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The piece
will be most helpful for communications staffers on active campaigns. I'm attempting to ask
and answer the question, "Is there a relationship between type of post (video, text, photo) 
and audience engagement?"

A limitation is that twitter only allows public tracking as far back as 3 months. Thus, the 
timeline will go back three months and track to the start date of tracking.

In pre-production, my research will rely on existing social media polling that 
confirms what types of media posts are most successful for political candidates. 
Most of these statistics come from marketing sites like Social Media Today, etc. 

Other possible sources include 2020 campaign communications staffers,
popular former and current congress members who are social media savy
like Ted Lieu (D-Ca.).

A pie chart would help visualize the percentage of a candidateâ€™s posts in the 
last 3 months were plainly text, video, picture, share or combination of media. A 
bar chart would help breakdown the number of likes, shares and comments per form of media.
